# Artificial-Intelligence_UWS
This is a uni group project where we developed a Java-based controller for micro-organisms on a grid surrounded by harmful chemicals, aiming to merge them into a single entity. We implemented and evaluated BFS, DFS, Iterative Deepening, Greedy, and A* search algorithms based on run-time, memory, and CPU usage.
